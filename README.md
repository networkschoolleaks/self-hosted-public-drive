# Self-Hosted Public Driveb 2

A decentralized public files management system that gives you full control over your content through peer-to-peer networks, decentralized ID, and public blockchains.

## Overview

This project provides a self-hosted approach to non-encrypted file management, offering users complete control over their infrastructure:

* Where you store your content
* How you host your static drive
* How you deploy your onchain smart account

## Disclaimer

This repository is experimental and focuses on a self-hosted approach to non-encrypted file management using peer-to-peer networks, decentralized ID, and public blockchains. This first version uses by default the The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), smart contracts on the Gnosis Chain, and Pimlico paymasters for account abstraction. You can run and maintain your self-hosted public drive by using other networks and infrastucture.

* **Account Abstraction**: Utilizes Pimlico paymasters
* **File Management**:
    * Upload and organize files
    * Create sections for better content organization
    * Preview supported file types
    * Public sharing capabilities
* **Public Drive System**:
    * Create and manage your own public drive
    * Proof of publishing verification
    * Owner address verification
    * Content hash tracking
    * Onchain record verification

## Technical Stack

* Frontend: React with TypeScript
* Storage: IPFS
* Blockchain: Gnosis Chain
* Smart contract: Fileverse
* Account Abstraction: Pimlico
* Styling: Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
3. Set up environment variables:
```env
VITE_ACCESS_CODE=your_access_code

VITE_RPC_URL=your_rpc_endpoint
```
4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

### Creating a Public Drive

1. Access the application
2. Choose "Create New"
3. Fill in drive details:
    * Public Drive Name
    * Public Drive Description
    * Pinata Keys (for IPFS)
    * RPC Endpoint

### Managing Files

* Upload files through the intuitive interface
* Organize content into sections
* Preview files directly in the application
* Share content publicly

### Verification

Each public drive provides proof of publishing with:

* Owner address (verified on Gnosisscan)
* Onchain record (verified on Gnosisscan)

## Architecture

The application follows a decentralized architecture:

* Frontend serves as a static interface
* IPFS handles content storage
* Smart contracts manage ownership and access
* Account abstraction provides seamless blockchain interactions

## Security

* Non-encrypted file management
* Public blockchain verification
* Decentralized identity management
* Smart contract-based access control

## License

GNU GPL v3

## Customization

You can customize your public drive by:

* Using different networks
* Implementing alternative middleware
* Modifying storage solutions / pinning services
* Adjusting smart contract interactions

## Support

While this is an experimental project with no official support, you can:

* Open issues for bugs
* Suggest improvements through pull requests
